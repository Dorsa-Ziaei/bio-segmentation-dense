# Dense Image Segmentation


Some codes for segmenting images via per-pixel (or dense) classification.  The core idea is based on semantic segmentation [Long et al.] and we borrow the architecture from [Ronneberger et al.].

**Note: this code is under construction and subject to change.  Use at your own risk! **
